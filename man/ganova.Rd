\title{
ANOVA table for linear hypothesis in a linear model
}
\description{
Prepares Analysis of Variance table for testing a general linear hypothesis in a linear model
}
\usage{
ganova(y, X, A, xi)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
Responese vector in linear model.
}
  \item{X}{
Design matrix or matrix containing values of explanatory variables (generally including intercept).
}
  \item{A}{
Coefficient matrix (A.beta = xi is the null hypothesis to be tested).
}
  \item{xi}{
A vector (A.beta = xi is the null hypothesis to be tested).
}
}

\value{
Returns analysis of variance table for testing A.beta = xi in the linear model with response vector y and matrix of explanatory variables/factors X.

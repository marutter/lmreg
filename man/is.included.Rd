\title{
Whether one column space is contained in another
}
\description{
Checks whether column space of one matrix is a subset of the column space of another matrix.
}
\usage{
is.included(B, A, tol1=sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), tol2=sqrt(.Machine$double.eps))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{B}{
The matrix whose column space is to be checked for being a subset.
}
  \item{A}{
The matrix whose column space is to be checked for being a superset.
}
 \item{tol1}{
A relative tolerance to detect zero singular values while computing generalized inverse, in case A is rank deficient (default = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)).
 }
 \item{tol2}{
A relative tolerance to detect whether there is sufficient closeness between B and A.ginv(A).B (default = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)).
 }
}

\value{
A logical value (TRUE if the column space of B is contained in the column space of A).
